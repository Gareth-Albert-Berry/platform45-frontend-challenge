## To start:
Please run yarn and then yarn start to start, the browser will open on localhost:3000 where the application will be served.

## Please note:
I animated the slider from right to left instead of left to right as I had a problem doing so.
On submit the fields will be validated and, if any, the errors will be displayed in the orange error style.
